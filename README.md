## About me
I am a undergraduate Saudi student from King Saud University, Riyadh; studying in College of Computer and Information Sciences (CCIS).

I have an interest for web development, particularly front-end programming. You can check my very simplistic VueJS project, and I'll develop a personal website in the future.
